    <h1>Data Analysis and Book Review</h1>

    <h2>Data Analysis: COVID-19 Dataset</h2>
    <p>
        I selected the <a href="https://github.com/datasets/covid-19">COVID-19 dataset</a>. 
        < In this dataset, there is time series data tracking the number of people affected by COVID-19 worldwide, including confirmed cases of infection, the number of people who died due to COVID-19, and the number of people who have recovered from COVID-19. This dataset can be used to calculate the estimated death rate of those infected by COVID-19 as time changes. It can also be used to calculate how fast it spreads and to predict how many people are going to be infected based on the number of confirmed cases. With knowledge of the death rate and infection speed, we can prepare medical supplies and emergency preparedness plans in advance.>

    <h2>Book Review: "The Evolution of Data Products" by Mike Loukides</h2>
    <p>
        I chose the book <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/radar/evolution-of-data-products/">"The Evolution of Data Products"</a>...
        < The author, Mike Loukides, is the Vice President of Content Strategy for O’Reilly Media, Inc. His main focus topics are data ethics, artificial intelligence, and the future of programming. He has also authored other books such as “Ethics and Data Science” and “System Performance Tuning," and coauthored "Unix Power Tools."

O’Reilly Media was founded in 1978 as a private firm for technical writing and information. It provides educational resources and platforms and publishes books.

As a beginner in the field of big data, I find that the viewpoints and insights presented at the start of this book closely resonate with my decision to delve into the study of big data. Throughout the book, the authors explore the concept that data is more than just a numerical entity for analysis; it is a tangible product with characteristics similar to physical entities.

In subsequent chapters, the authors delve into the pivotal role that machine learning and artificial intelligence play in the collection and analysis of data. Towards the end of the book, the author emphasizes that big data should strive to deliver a meaningful user experience. As technology advances, data will progressively recede into the background, allowing users to seamlessly benefit from its convenience without necessarily realizing they are utilizing it. >
